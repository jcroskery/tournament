# tournament
## Purpose
5 is an awkward number --- especially when you want to play Mario Kart with only one set of controllers!
This small GTK3 application allows you to manage 5-player Mario Kart tournaments where only two people race at a time. 
The tournament format consists of a group stage, a tiebreaker stage (if needed), a semifinal stage, a bronze-medal match, and a gold-medal match.
